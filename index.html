        A little about me!
    </h1>
    <span>
        I'm currently learning video game development, and I someday hope to set up my own studio. I also learn various other topics in my spare time, such as art, animal care and music production.
        <br>
        I am autistic, which basically means I am super awesome and cool B). (Just kidding, I suck.)
